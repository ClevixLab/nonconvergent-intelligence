# Non-Convergent Intelligence

This repository contains the code, computational simulations, and data supporting the research paper:

**“Non-Convergent Intelligence in Unbounded Knowledge Spaces: Entropy Dynamics, Learning Incompleteness, and Implications for AI Alignment.”**  
Published as a preprint on Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18143313



## 📘 Overview

Artificial Intelligence (AI) research typically assumes that learning converges to stable representations or optimal solutions.  
This work develops a theoretical and computational framework for **non-convergent intelligence**, where:

- **Knowledge Entropy** quantifies representation disorder,
- **Dynamic Knowledge Entropy** captures entropy drift over time,
- **Dynamic Intelligence Ceilings** constrain finite learners,
- **Learning Incompleteness** formalizes inherent limits on complete understanding.

The **Principle of Non-Convergent Intelligence (PNCI)** is introduced as a foundational result with implications for:
- Machine Learning Theory,
- Continual/Open-Ended Learning,
- AI Alignment and Safety.
